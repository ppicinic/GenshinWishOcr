## Running the bot
Open solution with Visual Studio 2019 and build the solution. You will need .netcore3.1.
Run the exe with the following commandline parameters
GenshinWishOcr.exe PngSequenceFolder outputfilename.csv multithreadPercentage

multithreadPercentage is optional and should be a double value that will utilize a % of your device's cpu's cores. Full utilization is probably most optimal with 1.5 but you may use .75 for to leave a little bit of your CPU untaxed.

GenshinWishOcr.exe C:/MyWishImageSequence/ C:/mywishes.csv
GenshinWishOcr.exe C:/MyWishImageSequence/ C:/mywishes.csv .75
GenshinWishOcr.exe C:/MyWishImageSequence/ C:/mywishes.csv 1.5
